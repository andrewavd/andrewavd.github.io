          <h2>What is Seriously Amazing?</h2>
          <p>
            Seriously amazing is a two way street, a symbiotic relationship. Too be amazing you must make those around
            you amazing and in turn they must make you amzing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seriously amazing is gratitude. I had a chance to take a cursory look at your relationship with Beyond the Orphanage,
            gratitude is woven completely through that entire endeavor.
          </p>
          <p>Seriously amazing is faith. "None of us is as strong as all of us." It takes faith once you get beyond yourself.</p>
          <p>Seriously amazing is putting back more than what you take.</p>
          <p>
            It's probably evident at this point that seriously amazing isn't a skill or an ability in my belief system, it's a mindset.
            The seriously amazing thing though is that mindset is what makes the coding and the passion and the intelligence and likeability
            so seriously amazing!

          <h2>Andy is...</h2>

          <span style="color:red">PASSIONATE</span>
          <p>
            Committed to and following a path of mastery. Mastery is the journey that never ends.
            To a large degree this is our lot in life, you contribute knowing you will not get to witness
            the end of the show... it's an act of faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the areas in my life where I believe the pursuit of mastery has helped:
            Being a Dad, parenting comes with no "how to" guide. Running, I like to run marathons.
            As I've aged my performance has declined but my ability to adapt has increased. Programming, its much
            like the marathon. Things are constantly changing and you begin to "feel" what's show and what's substance.
          </p>

          <span style="color:green">SMART</span>
          <p>
            Smart is having a passion for becoming smarter. What makes becoming smarter seriously amazing is getting past the ego
            and being able to say, "I don't know", rather than laying out some lame story that ends up embarrassing everyone.
          </p>
          <p>It's a cliche, but the more I've learned, the more I've realized how little I know.</p>

          <span style="color:BLUE">NICE</span>
          <p>I will need to defer to others regarding how "nice" I am. LIke many things in life,
            we can't control the outcome of how nice we are judged to be, only the process. What I will say is I do
            believe the basis of nice lies in "love your neighbor as you would love yourself."
            (Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.)

              The assessment of each other's talents is in it's infancy at this juncture but a large part
              of talent/contribution comes from diversity. The remote model addresses this in part by default
              and I'm excited to be a part of that if I make the grade. (Geographical diversity = cultural diversity)
              Unfortunately we all are keenly aware of the rest of the "ism"s in the field.
